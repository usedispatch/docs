# Degenerate Ape Academy Launches Degeniverse Discussions


Hot on the heels of their launch of Homeroom, Degenerate Ape Academy (DAA) is proving it’s time NFT projects to consider truly native web3 community, this time with the launch of Degeniverse Discussions hosted on Dispatch Forums. The team kicked things off with an AMA on their gold star rewards, making it the first project (that we know of) to host such a discussion on Solana or any blockchain for that matter. 

In planning for Degeniverse Discussions, DAA worked with Dispatch to create a forum experience where apes could earn gold stars for smart (funny or just plain dumb) questions and important project updates would be written to the Solana blockchain. Creating a decentralized and censorship-resistant community has its merits, as Crass Kitty, Product at DAA, explains, “We wanted all of our community answers to be easily found in the future, meaning they had to be logged on-chain.” She continues continues, “Twitter and Discord lack the permanence that a lot of people who don’t have the time to constantly engage with these channels need.” And for recognizing that, we are calling DAA a bunch of degeniuses. Degenii, even.

DAA’s first discussion, Gold Stars AMA, showed impressive engagement with over 400+ replies and 170+ users per minute. To handle the demand, Dispatch stress tested the forum on the Solana network prior to launch with good success. 

What’s next for Degeniverse Discussions on Dispatch Forums? We’re told a few more surprises and a tighter integration of discussions in the Homeroom experience. Also, moAr hoMeWoRk.
