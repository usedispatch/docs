# Degenerate Ape Academy Launches Degeniverse Discussions


Degenerate Ape Academy (DAA) is taking their ecosystem to the next level with some impressive launches including Homeroom, a hub for apes to interact and collect awards like gold stars, which can be traded for loot boxes.

In creating Homeroom, DAA wanted to build a truly native web3 community. They teamed up with Dispatch Forums to launch Degeniverse Discussions, where apes earn gold stars and important project updates are written to the Solana blockchain in a decentralized, censorship-resistant type-of-way. Crass Kitty, Product at DAA, explains, “We wanted all of our community answers to be easily found in the future, meaning they had to be logged on-chain.”

While Twitter and Discord are often the usual suspects for NFT project updates, the team behind DAA felt they would not be long term solutions for Homeroom. Crass Kitty again explains, “Twitter and Discord lack the permanence that a lot of people who don’t have the time to constantly engage with these channels need.” And for recognizing that, we are calling DAA a bunch of degeniuses. degenii, even.
What’s next for Degeniverse Discussions on Dispatch Forums? We’re told a few more surprises and a tighter integration of discussions in the Homeroom experience. Also, moAr hoMeWoRk.
