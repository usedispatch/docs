# About Dispatch On-Chain Forums

## Overview

Once upon a time, there was an amazing community in search of an amazing community platform. They tried Discord, but there were scammers and spammers galore. They tried Slack, but Slack kept raising prices. They tried Facebook Groups, but Facebook displayed ads of their competitors. 

Without native wallet integrations and on-chain identity, the amazing community couldnâ€™t enable rich web3 use cases like token-gating discussions or having users amass karma tokens (real internet points!). 

The amazing community realized it was time for their community to reach its full potential. They needed a decentralized platform, one that was grounded in ethos of web3 with full transparency and incentives. 

Enter Dispatch â€” where anyone can set up their community, invite moderators, and host public forums. As an on-chain forum, the community writes their posts to the actual Solana Blockchain.

### The Dispatch Pitch

If you are building your community for the long term, we encourage you to consider Dispatch.

- **Itâ€™s proven.** Communities like Degen Ape Academy, Solanart, and Holaplex use Dispatch.
- **Itâ€™s built for creators.** Have your community name, moderatorsâ€™ wallets, and NFT Collection ID (if you are token gating) ready. Your community is launched in a few clicks.
- **Engage your community.** Your forums comes with ability to create topics, up-voting, token-gating, threaded comments, and analytics (coming soon).
- **Do more with developer tools.** Embed your Dispatch forum on your own site and support 1:1 private messaging.

### Other Web3 Platforms

Other web3 platforms have many good aspects. But, together with the help of a few web3 communities, we found these platforms did not quite have the full-range of features of what our community partners needed â€” like sending NFTs, or hosting forums on their own site. 

We wanted Dispatch to bring to life some of the more imaginative web3 uses cases and empower communities to incentivize their users.

ðŸ“Œ Communities can set up a token-gated forum, add moderatorsâ€™ wallets, and send tokens to their community. If you have a developer on your team, you can build more user scenarios like support for 1:1 private messaging, and automatically issuing incentives when a certain criteria for user behavior is met. Our partners wanted the basics to be easy, for any creator to get stuff done, but still have the option to create unique web3 experiences with a little bit of code.
