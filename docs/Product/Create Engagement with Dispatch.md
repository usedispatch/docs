# Create Engagement with Dispatch

Most NFT token holders are exactly that, just token holders. They aren’t in your awesome Discord community, and they aren’t soaking up the awesome perks of being a NFT holder. 

In talking with over 20+ communities, we discovered two opportunities for building online engagement and welcoming more users into web3 communities. 

1. Projects felt trapped by the limitations of web2 community platforms for web3 communities. They couldn’t do the “cool things” that were only possible in web3.
2. Discord and Twitter were noisy and only had one speed — lots of async chatter. Important information would get lost. Sometimes, introverts and less frequent users didn’t feel comfortable enough to participate. 

We designed Dispatch to work with your existing community, and to complement Discord, Twitter, or wherever it’s hosted. In its most basic form, Dispatch allows you to create topics and share these topics as links in your web2 community platform. 

For purist communities that want a fully on-chain experience, Dispatch can be used as a stand-alone forum with the option to integrate into your own site or app using our React SDK. Partners like Solanart and Holaplex have chosen this route. 

## Engagement Ideas

Once you’ve set up your [Dispatch Forum](Getting Started with Dispatch.md), here are some ideas to create engagement for your community. We’ll keep this page up to date with the latest tips from communities already on Dispatch. 

### Meme Contests

Award NFTs to the user with the most up-voted meme. We are dying to do an Elon Musk meme contest ourselves. 

### Polling your Community

Ask your community where your next IRL meetup should be. You can even create several replies as options, like a poll, and see which one gets up-voted.  

### Governance

You can poll your community about serious stuff too. We’ve found that up-voting and down-voting are great mechanisms to collect votes. Wallets can only up-vote a reply once. 

### Bounties

Your community can earn SOL and NFTs for doing tasks like fixing bugs, writing content, or hosting a Twitter space. Everyone builds their on-chain reputation. 

### AMAs

Imagine asking your hero a question and them writing their answer to the Solana blockchain. Hell yah. In September, we’re hosting AMAs with various makers in the Solana ecosystem. 

### Announcements

Write your important project updates to the blockchain like a boss. 

### FAQs and Community Rules

Like announcements, some of our launch partners also create forum topics for other important stuffs including FAQs and Community Rules. If Moses wrote the 10 Commandments on stone, I’m writing the community rules for the Bored Bananas on the Solana Blockchain.
