# Solanart Uses Dispatch

We worked with Solanart, one of the largest NFT marketplaces on Solana, to launch private 1:1 messaging. Learn why Solanart wanted to enable messaging for its users and how you can do it too for your project. 

Degens love NFTs and on Solanart, many of their users hunt and trade NFTs daily. When an NFT is listed for sale, the owner wants to sell the NFT for the max amount of SOL. The user wants to buy the NFT for the least amount of SOL. We call this basic economics for degens.

Solanart had enabled buyers to offer a price but many buyers were actually looking to chat with sellers about their NFT in order to haggle their price. 

For sellers, they could reject an offer but not communicate why the offer was NGMI. 

Enter Dispatch Messaging. Using Dispatchâ€™s SDK, Solanart was able to set up private 1:1 messaging between buyers and sellers. See [demo video](https://twitter.com/i/status/1512595540017659905).

Dispatch messaging also supports 1:many messaging. To get started, grab your developer and checkout the [Dispatch Protocol SDK](https://docs.dispatch.forum/docs/developer).
